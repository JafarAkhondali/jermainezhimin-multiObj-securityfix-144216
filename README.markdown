Hi!

You have navigated into the source code folder of a SUTD graphics course term project
written by Jermaine, Zikang and Ping. <br> 
For javascript to be able to access local resources(skybox pics), you need to run it 
as an web app on localhost using: <br>
	`node app.js`

and enter the following URL in your browser: <br>
	`http://localhost:8888/ball.html`

from there, you can click on two buttons named "the sea" and "isosurfaces & metaballs" to
access two other web pages. =) 

#Source code structure:

|--- ball.html (transparent balls)
|--- ocean.html (the sea)
|--- merge.html (isosurfaces & metaballs)

|--- style.css (some styling)
|--- textures (water textures & lensflares resources used in ocean.html)
|--- skybox (skybox resources used in ball.html and merge.html)

|--- three.min.js (three.js framework)
|--- js (javascript extensions to three.min.js written by open-source heroes)

Thanks!
